	<h2> Film Studies Program </h2>
	<img src="../Images/film.jpg" />
	<p> The film studies program is for people who need to fulfill their last general 
education requirement but would rather be in another problem solving course. Topics of study 
include watching movies and talking about them afterwards. </p>
	<p> This semester I am taking one course from this program.</p>
